## Enclosure

As you can see the PCB is fairly bigger than it should be, that's because it's supposed to fit inside [this project box](http://www.aliexpress.com/item/Aluminum-Project-Box-150x105x55mm-Electronic-DIY-Power-amplifier-aluminum-shell-PCB-shell-Terminal-block-instrument-shell/1833717877.html).
